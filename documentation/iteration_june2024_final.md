# June 2024 Final Iteration: 4-Day Sweet Spot Discovery

## Executive Summary
**Major breakthrough:** Discovered that 4-day trips are treated as a special "business sweet spot" by the black-box system and should NOT be penalized for high spending. This insight led to significant performance improvement.

## Performance Metrics
- **Average Error:** $272.59 (best result yet)
- **Maximum Error:** $698.43 (down from $735.33)
- **Score:** 27,359 (lower is better)
- **Exact Matches:** 0
- **Close Matches:** 3

## Key Breakthrough: 4-Day Trip Analysis

### Evidence That Led to Discovery
1. **All top error cases were 4-day trips** with very high receipts ($1300-1800)
2. **Expected outputs were ~2x our calculated outputs**, indicating massive under-reimbursement
3. **Interview evidence from Jennifer:** "Sweet spot around 4-6 days where reimbursements are particularly good"
4. **Data contradiction:** Our penalty-based approach conflicted with observed generous treatment

### Implementation
- **Removed all per-day spending penalties for 4-day trips**
- Kept efficiency-based receipt processing but no additional multiplier penalties
- This reflects the black-box system's generous treatment of 4-day business trips

### Results
- **Eliminated 4-day trips from top error cases**
- Maximum error reduced from $735+ to $698
- No degradation in other trip types

## Current Algorithm State

### Working Well
1. **Base per diem structure** - Solid foundation
2. **Efficiency-based receipt processing** - Core insight working
3. **5-day bonus** - Interview-validated and performing well
4. **Small receipt penalties** - Effective and interview-backed
5. **Multi-day receipt caps** - Handles extreme cases
6. **4-day trip exemption** - Major breakthrough

### Current Challenges
**Top error cases are now all 7+ day trips with high receipts:**
- Case 271: 7 days, 623 miles, $1691.39 receipts (Expected: $1800.86, Got: $1102.43)
- Case 149: 7 days, 1006 miles, $1181.33 receipts (Expected: $2279.82, Got: $1585.43)
- Pattern: Medium-high mileage (600-1000 miles) 7+ day trips getting under-reimbursed

## Interview Pattern Validation

### Strongly Supported by Multiple Sources
- ✅ **5-day bonus** (Lisa, Jennifer)
- ✅ **Small receipt penalties** (Lisa, Dave, Jennifer)
- ✅ **Efficiency sweet spots** (Kevin, Lisa)
- ✅ **4-6 day trip sweet spot** (Jennifer, Kevin)
- ✅ **Receipt amount curves** (Lisa, Kevin)

### Evidence-Based Insights
- ✅ **4-day trips get special treatment** (data-driven discovery)
- ✅ **High-mileage exemptions** (prevents over-penalization)
- ⚠️ **7+ day spending limits may need refinement** (current top errors)

## Technical Implementation Status

### Current Logic Flow
1. **Base per diem** by trip length
2. **Tiered mileage calculation**
3. **Efficiency-based receipt processing** (6 zones)
4. **Multi-day receipt caps** (5+ days, >$1500)
5. **Per-day spending multipliers:**
   - 4-day trips: **NO PENALTY** (sweet spot)
   - 5-6 day trips: Penalty if >$120/day
   - 7+ day trips: Penalty if >$90/day AND <800 miles
6. **Special adjustments** (5-day bonus, small receipt penalties, rounding bug)

### Code Quality
- **Named constants** for all thresholds
- **Modular structure** for easy testing
- **Clear comments** explaining business logic
- **Evidence-based rationale** for each component

## Next Investigation Priorities

### 1. 7+ Day High-Receipt Analysis (High Priority)
- Current top error pattern suggests spending penalties may be too harsh
- Consider raising the mileage exemption threshold from 800 to 600 miles
- Or adjust the spending limit from $90/day to $120/day for medium-mileage long trips

### 2. Sweet Spot Range Refinement (Medium Priority)
- Kevin mentioned 180-220 mi/day specifically
- Current "sweet spot" zone is 180+ mi/day
- May need to narrow the range and adjust rates

### 3. Calendar Effects Investigation (Low Priority)
- Multiple interviews mention timing effects
- Current data doesn't show clear calendar patterns
- Insufficient evidence to implement without more data

## Lessons Learned

### Successful Strategies
1. **Evidence-driven development** - Don't implement without data support
2. **Interview triangulation** - Multiple sources increase confidence
3. **Error case analysis** - High-error cases reveal algorithm gaps
4. **Incremental testing** - Small changes prevent over-engineering
5. **Data contradicts assumptions** - Be willing to reverse course

### Avoided Pitfalls
1. **Over-aggressive penalties** - Previous iteration caused negative reimbursements
2. **Assumption-based implementation** - Waited for evidence before adding features
3. **Complex calendar logic** - Avoided without clear data support
4. **Department-specific rules** - No evidence in current data

## Conclusion
The 4-day trip sweet spot discovery represents a major algorithmic breakthrough. By carefully analyzing error patterns and cross-referencing with interview evidence, we identified a key business rule that significantly improved performance. The algorithm now accurately captures the black-box system's generous treatment of 4-day business trips while maintaining appropriate controls for other trip types.

**Current state:** Strong foundation with targeted opportunities for 7+ day trip optimization.
