# June 2024 Interview Pattern Implementation

## Executive Summary
After reverting the over-aggressive per-day spending penalty, we return to evidence-driven improvements based on patterns mentioned by multiple interviewees. Current performance: **$239.41 average error**, which is our best result yet.

## Multi-Interviewee Patterns (High Confidence)

### 1. Kevin's Per-Day Spending Limits
**Sources:** Kevin (detailed analysis), Jennifer (general observation)
- Short trips: <$75/day optimal
- Medium trips (4-6 days): <$120/day optimal  
- Long trips: <$90/day optimal
- **Evidence:** Case 711 (5 days, $375/day spending) shows massive overestimation

### 2. Efficiency Sweet Spot (180-220 mi/day)
**Sources:** Kevin (specific range), Lisa (general efficiency bonus)
- Current algorithm has efficiency zones but may not match the 180-220 sweet spot precisely
- **Evidence:** Need to analyze if current "sweet spot" zone (180+ mi/day) aligns with interview data

### 3. Receipt Amount Sweet Spots
**Sources:** Lisa (detailed), Kevin (confirms $600-800 range)
- Medium-high amounts ($600-800) get best treatment
- Very high amounts get diminishing returns
- **Evidence:** Current algorithm has this but may need refinement

### 4. Small Receipt Penalties
**Sources:** Lisa, Dave, Jennifer (all confirm)
- Already implemented and working well

### 5. 5-Day Bonus
**Sources:** Lisa (specific), Jennifer (confirms)
- Already implemented and working well

## Current High-Error Case Analysis

### Case 711: 5 days, 516 miles, $1878.49 receipts
- Expected: $669.85, Got: $1507.30 (Error: $837.45)
- Miles/day: 103.2 (below sweet spot, standard efficiency)
- Spending/day: $375.70 (**far above Kevin's $120/day limit**)
- **Problem:** Current algorithm gives moderate receipt treatment, should apply penalty for excessive per-day spending

### Case 684: 8 days, 795 miles, $1645.99 receipts  
- Expected: $644.69, Got: $1368.45 (Error: $723.76)
- Miles/day: 99.4 (low efficiency)
- Spending/day: $205.75 (**above Kevin's $90/day limit for long trips**)
- **Problem:** Similar to Case 711, excessive spending per day not penalized enough

## Proposed Implementation Strategy

### 1. Refined Per-Day Spending Logic (Not Blanket Penalties)
Instead of harsh penalties that caused negative reimbursements, implement **progressive multipliers**:

- **Medium trips (4-6 days):** If spending > $120/day, reduce receipt rates by 20-30%
- **Long trips (7+ days):** If spending > $90/day, reduce receipt rates by 30-40%
- **Apply to receipt component only, not base per diem or mileage**

### 2. Sweet Spot Refinement
- Verify if current 180+ zone should be narrowed to 180-220 range
- May need to adjust bonus rates for precise sweet spot

### 3. Avoid Over-Engineering
- Focus on the highest-error cases first
- Test each change individually to avoid previous over-penalization
- Use multiplicative adjustments rather than subtractive penalties

## Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority:** Per-day spending multipliers for medium/long trips
2. **Medium Priority:** Sweet spot range refinement  
3. **Low Priority:** Calendar effects (insufficient evidence in current data)

## Expected Impact
- Target Case 711 error reduction: $837 → <$400
- Target Case 684 error reduction: $723 → <$350
- Maintain current performance on other cases
