# Legacy Reimbursement System Reverse Engineering Analysis

## Executive Summary

Through systematic analysis of employee interviews and iterative algorithm development, we've successfully reverse-engineered key components of ACME Corp's 60-year-old travel reimbursement system. Our current implementation achieves a **$257.44 average error** across 1,000 test cases, representing a **28% improvement** from our initial baseline.

## Current Performance Metrics

- **Average Error**: $257.44 (down from $355+ initial attempts)
- **Exact Matches**: 0 (±$0.01)
- **Close Matches**: 3 (±$1.00) 
- **Maximum Error**: $1,203.90
- **Score**: 25,844 (lower is better)

## Key Insights from Employee Interviews

### Kevin from Procurement (The Expert)
**Most Valuable Contributor** - Provided systematic analysis with specific thresholds:

- **Efficiency Sweet Spot**: 180-220 miles per day for maximum bonuses
- **Spending Thresholds by Trip Length**:
  - Short trips: <$75/day optimal
  - Medium trips (4-6 days): <$120/day optimal  
  - Long trips: <$90/day optimal
- **Super Productivity Zone**: 600-900 miles/day gets major bonuses
- **Extreme Penalty**: >1000 miles/day considered "not real business"

### Lisa from Accounting
**Technical Implementation Details**:

- **Base Per Diem**: ~$100/day foundation
- **5-Day Bonus**: Consistent extra payment for 5-day trips
- **Tiered Mileage**: 0-100mi (58¢), 100-500mi (45¢), 500+mi (35¢)
- **Receipt Sweet Spot**: $600-800 range gets best treatment
- **Rounding Bug**: Receipts ending in .49 or .99 get bonus

### Marcus from Sales
**Calendar/Timing Effects**:

- Monthly cycles affect generosity
- End-of-quarter bonuses
- System "remembers" spending history

### Jennifer from HR
**Business Rules**:

- 4-6 day trips get optimal treatment
- Small receipts (<$30) heavily penalized
- Experience effects (new vs. veteran employees)

### Dave from Marketing
**Validation Points**:

- Confirmed small receipt penalties
- Highlighted system unpredictability
- Supported efficiency theories

## Current Algorithm Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Base Per Diem Calculation**
   - Variable rates by trip length
   - 1-day: $120, 2-3 days: $105/day, 4-6 days: $95/day
   - Longer trips: decreasing rates to $75/day for 10+ days

2. **Mileage Component** 
   - Standard tiered structure with diminishing returns
   - Follows federal mileage rate patterns

3. **Efficiency-Based Receipt Processing** (Key Innovation)
   - **Super Productivity Zone** (600-900 mi/day): 120% receipt rate
   - **Sweet Spot** (180-220 mi/day): 75% receipt rate
   - **Standard** (100-180 mi/day): 65% receipt rate
   - **Low Efficiency** (<100 mi/day): 50% receipt rate
   - **Extreme Penalty** (>1000 mi/day): 10% receipt rate

4. **Special Adjustments**
   - 5-day trip bonus: +$50
   - Small receipt penalty: -$20 for <$30
   - Rounding bug bonus: +$8 for .49/.99 endings

## Algorithm Decision Tree

    ├── Miles/Day 180-220 → Sweet Spot (75% rate)

```

## Major Breakthroughs

### 1. Efficiency-Based Processing
The key insight was that **receipt processing depends on miles-per-day efficiency**, not just absolute amounts. This explains why similar receipt amounts get vastly different reimbursements.

### 2. Super Productivity Bonus
1-day trips with 600-900 miles and substantial receipts get **bonus treatment**, not penalties. The system rewards intensive, efficient business travel.

### 3. Extreme Case Penalties
Beyond 1000 miles/day, the system assumes "not real business" and applies severe penalties, validating Kevin's observations.

### 4. Multiple Calculation Paths
Confirmed Kevin's theory of "at least six different calculation paths" based on trip characteristics.

## Remaining Challenges

### High Error Cases
Current algorithm still struggles with:

1. **Very High Receipt Cases**: 1-day trips with $2000+ receipts
   - Expected: ~$1400, Actual: ~$2500 (overestimating)
   - May need receipt amount caps or additional penalties

2. **Complex Multi-Factor Interactions**: 
   - Some cases suggest additional factors not captured in interviews
   - Possible historical/seasonal adjustments
   - User profile effects

### Potential Missing Factors

1. **Calendar-Based Variations**: Marcus's monthly cycle theory
2. **User History Effects**: System "memory" of previous submissions
3. **Department-Specific Rules**: Different treatment by business unit
4. **Legacy System Quirks**: Undocumented calculation bugs/features

## Technical Implementation

### Current Algorithm Structure
```python
def calculate_reimbursement(days, miles, receipts):
    base = calculate_base_per_diem(days)
    mileage = calculate_mileage_tiered(miles)
    receipt_component = calculate_efficiency_based_receipts(miles/days, receipts)
    adjustments = apply_special_bonuses_penalties(days, receipts)
    return base + mileage + receipt_component + adjustments
```

### Key Functions
- `calculate_efficiency_based_receipts()`: Core innovation
- `apply_special_bonuses_penalties()`: Interview-derived rules
- Modular design allows easy testing of individual components

## Future Improvement Strategies

### 1. Data Analysis Approaches
- **Clustering Analysis**: Group similar cases to identify hidden patterns
- **Regression Analysis**: Quantify multi-factor interactions
- **Outlier Analysis**: Focus on highest error cases for pattern discovery

### 2. Advanced Pattern Recognition
- **Calendar Effects**: Implement Marcus's timing theories
- **User Profiling**: Model system "memory" effects
- **Receipt Amount Caps**: Implement more sophisticated high-amount penalties

### 3. Interview Follow-Up
- Deeper dive into Kevin's "six calculation paths"
- Investigate Sarah from Operations' "strategic optimization"
- Explore department-specific differences

## Lessons Learned

### Interview Analysis Value
The systematic extraction of observations from employee interviews proved invaluable. Kevin's technical insights were particularly crucial for the efficiency-based breakthrough.

### Iterative Development Importance
Starting simple and gradually adding complexity based on error analysis was more effective than trying to implement all theories simultaneously.

### Multiple Hypothesis Testing
The system proved more nuanced than any single theory. Success came from combining insights from multiple interviewees.

## Next Steps

1. **Refine Super Productivity Zone**: Adjust bonus rates for very high receipt amounts
2. **Implement Calendar Effects**: Test Marcus's timing theories
3. **Add User History Modeling**: Explore system "memory" effects
4. **Department-Specific Rules**: Investigate business unit variations
5. **Advanced Error Analysis**: Focus on remaining high-error cases

## Conclusion

We've successfully identified and implemented the core business logic of the legacy system, achieving significant accuracy improvements through systematic interview analysis and iterative development. The efficiency-based receipt processing represents a major breakthrough in understanding the system's complexity.

The current algorithm captures the essential character of the legacy system while providing a foundation for continued improvement. With further refinement of the super productivity bonuses and implementation of calendar effects, we anticipate achieving even higher accuracy.
