# Interview Observations Analysis

## Marcus from Sales

### Calendar/Timing Effects
- "The system looks at the calendar. I swear it's more generous at certain times of the month"
- "First trip was early March, second was late March" - different reimbursements for similar trips
- Theory: Monthly quotas or cycles

### Trip Length Patterns
- "Everyone says there's a sweet spot around 5-6 days"
- 8-day swing through Ohio/Indiana got "incredible" reimbursement
- 7-day conference in Denver got "peanuts" despite similar profile

### Mileage Patterns
- "Short drives, you get the standard rate, no surprises"
- "Longer drives? It's like the system gets confused"
- 600-mile trip: expected $350, got $298 (non-linear)
- 800-mile trip reportedly got better per-mile rate than 600-mile

### Receipt Patterns
- "$2,000 expense weeks that got me less than $1,200 weeks"
- "Definitely some kind of cap or penalty for spending too much"
- $60/day modest expenses got decent reimbursement
- $90/day expenses got worse reimbursement
- "End of Q4, the system is definitely more generous"

### System Memory Theory
- "The system remembers your history"
- "If you've been submitting a lot of big expense reports, it starts getting stingy"
- "If you keep it modest for a few months, it gets more generous"

### Misc Theories
- "Magic number" theory: $847 supposedly lucky
- "Efficiency bonus" theory: extra money for covering lots of ground quickly
- "Rounding bug" theory: certain cents amounts mess up calculation in your favor

## Lisa from Accounting

### Per Diem Base
- "$100 a day seems to be the base"
- "5-day trips almost always get a bonus" (except one case)
- "4-day trips, 6-day trips, normal rates. But 5 days? Always a little extra"

### Mileage Calculation
- "Definitely tiered. First 100 miles or so, you get the full rate—like 58 cents per mile"
- "After that, it drops"
- "It's some kind of curve. High-mileage trips still pay well, just not proportionally"
- "Sometimes I think it's logarithmic"

### Receipt Processing
- "Definitely a cap on how much of your receipts get reimbursed, but it's not a hard cap"
- "$1,000 receipts → $800 reimbursed; $1,200 receipts → $850 reimbursed" (diminishing returns)
- "Medium-high amounts—like $600-800—seem to get really good treatment"
- "Really low amounts get penalized"
- "$50 receipts for multi-day trip, you're better off submitting nothing"
- "$30 receipt totals get decent reimbursements, $80 totals get penalties"

### Trip Categories
- "Quick trips with high mileage get treated differently than long trips with low mileage"
- "Efficiency thing is real. People who cover a lot of ground in a short time get bonuses"
- "200 miles per day got smaller bonus than 150 miles per day" (other factors matter)

### Rounding Bug
- "If your receipts end in 49 or 99 cents, you often get a little extra money"
- "Like the system rounds up twice or something"

### Variation Patterns
- "Same person, same type of trip, different reimbursements. Usually small differences—5-10%"
- "Could be seasonal, could be some kind of randomization"

## Dave from Marketing

### Unpredictability
- Austin conference vs Phoenix conference: identical setup, "way worse reimbursement" for Phoenix
- Cleveland to Detroit (similar trips): $847 vs $623

### Distance Effects
- Chicago (300 miles): "Good mileage reimbursement"
- Indianapolis (less far): "mileage rate seemed higher per mile"

### Receipt Thresholds
- "Don't submit tiny amounts"
- "$12 parking receipt: reimbursement usually worse than just leaving it off"
- "$900 expenses → maybe $600 reimbursed"
- Kevin's $1,200 expense weeks got "almost full reimbursement"

### Colleague Theories
- Sarah from ops: "magic combination of days and miles and spending"
- Kevin: "charts and graphs trying to predict reimbursements"
- Kevin: "submission timing tied to lunar cycles"

## Jennifer from HR

### Experience Effects
- "New employees tend to get lower reimbursements at first"
- "Long-term employees seem to do better"

### Pitfalls
- "Small receipts thing is real. We always warn new hires not to submit tiny expense amounts"
- "Better to keep receipts over a certain threshold"

### Timing Effects
- "Some people swear by end-of-quarter submissions, others say mid-month is better"

### Trip Length Sweet Spot
- "Sweet spot around 4-6 days where reimbursements are particularly good"
- "Shorter or longer than that, and people are often disappointed"
- Theory: "System was designed to encourage a certain type of business travel"

### Department Differences
- Sales: "seems to do better overall"
- Finance/accounting: "usually happy with their reimbursements, but they're also more conservative"
- Operations: "mixed results"
- Sarah from ops: "very strategic about her trips. She plans routes and timing specifically to optimize reimbursements"

## Kevin from Procurement (The Expert)

### Efficiency Sweet Spot
- "Sweet spot around 180-220 miles per day where bonuses are maximized"
- "Go too low, penalty. Go too high, bonuses start dropping off again"
- "System thinks you're not actually doing business if you're driving 400 miles a day"

### Spending Thresholds by Trip Length
- Short trips: "keep it under $75 per day"
- Medium trips (4-6 days): "up to $120 per day and still get good treatment"
- Long trips: "better keep it under $90 per day or you'll get penalized"

### Timing Effects
- "Tuesday submissions consistently outperform Monday submissions"
- "Thursday is also good. Never submit on Friday"
- "Tuesday is 8% higher on average than Friday"
- "New moon submissions average 4% higher than full moon submissions"

### Calculation Paths
- "At least six different calculation paths depending on trip characteristics"
- "Quick high-mileage trips get calculated differently than long low-mileage trips"

### Specific Bonus/Penalty Combinations
- **Sweet Spot Combo**: "5-day trips with 180+ miles per day and under $100 per day spending—guaranteed bonus"
- **Vacation Penalty**: "8+ day trips with high spending—guaranteed penalty"
- **Generally Good**: "High mileage with low spending"
- **Generally Bad**: "Low mileage with high spending"

### Interaction Effects
- "It's not just about individual factors—it's about interactions between factors"
- "Trip length times efficiency, spending per day times total mileage"
- "Threshold effects: certain combinations trigger bonuses, other combinations trigger penalties"

### System Adaptation
- "System has some kind of learning or adaptation component"
- "Early trips got different treatment than recent trips"
- "Could build a profile of each user and adjusts accordingly"

### Randomization
- "Some kind of randomization algorithm tied to external data sources"
- "Maybe market indices, maybe astronomical data, maybe pseudo-random number generators"
- "Noise is intentional to prevent gaming, but small enough that optimization still works"
