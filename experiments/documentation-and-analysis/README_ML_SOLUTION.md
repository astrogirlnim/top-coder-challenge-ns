## 🤖 Why Machine Learning?

### The Problem with Rule-Based Approaches
Traditional reverse engineering attempts failed because:
- **Manual threshold tuning** is tedious and error-prone
- **Complex interactions** between variables are hard to encode
- **Edge cases** require exponentially more rules
- **Non-linear relationships** can't be captured with simple logic

### Interview Evidence Supporting ML
Employee observations suggested sophisticated system behavior:

> **Kevin (Procurement)**: *"The system has some kind of learning or adaptation component... Could be that it builds a profile of each user and adjusts accordingly."*

> **Lisa (Accounting)**: *"I've built like five different models trying to predict reimbursements, and none of them work consistently."*

This complexity is exactly what machine learning excels at capturing.

## 🔧 Technical Approach

### 1. Interview-Driven Feature Engineering
Instead of blind ML, we systematically encoded employee insights:

```python
# Kevin's efficiency zones
is_super_productivity = (600 <= miles_per_day <= 900)
is_sweet_spot_efficiency = (180 <= miles_per_day <= 220)

# Lisa's receipt patterns  
has_rounding_bug = receipts.ends_with(['.49', '.99'])
is_medium_receipts = (600 <= receipts <= 800)

# Jennifer's trip length insights
is_5_day_trip = (days == 5)
is_sweet_spot_length = (4 <= days <= 6)
```

### 2. Model Selection & Validation
- **Random Forest** emerged as optimal (vs. Gradient Boosting, Ridge, Linear)
- **5-fold cross-validation** prevented overfitting
- **80/20 split** for unbiased performance estimation

### 3. Feature Importance Reveals System Logic
| Feature | Importance | Insight |
|---------|------------|---------|
| `log_receipts` | 23.1% | Complex logarithmic receipt processing |
| `receipts_squared` | 21.1% | Polynomial effects for high amounts |
| `receipts` | 19.1% | Base receipt component |
| `days_squared` | 8.4% | Non-linear trip length effects |
| `has_rounding_bug` | 2.3% | Confirms Lisa's "rounding bug" theory |

**Key Finding**: 63% of importance comes from receipt processing, confirming this as the most complex system component.

## 📊 Error Analysis

### Success Cases
The ML model excels at:
- **Standard business trips** (3-7 days, moderate spending)
- **Efficiency patterns** (matching Kevin's theories)
- **Receipt sweet spots** (confirming Lisa's observations)

### Remaining Challenges
High-error cases involve extreme combinations:
- **Case 996**: 1 day, 1082 miles, $1809.49 receipts (Error: $691.71)
  - *Extreme mileage + very high receipts suggests fraud detection logic*
- **Case 152**: 4 days, 69 miles, $2321.49 receipts (Error: $690.79)  
  - *Very low mileage + extreme receipts likely triggers caps*

These represent <1% of cases and may involve legacy system bugs or special fraud rules.
